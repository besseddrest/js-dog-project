# Get a load of these dogs!

This app was created as a part of preparing for a React interview in JS

Clone this repo, run npm install, then npm start, and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see those dogs in action!

Upon loading, the app calls two APIs, one for dog images, one for dog facts - and displays the results in cards. Here's a breakdown of the features:

## Favorite your favorite dogs

## Sort alphabetically

## Show only one dog

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
